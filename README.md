# How to get pacman running on OpenShift

## What is missing?

In this deployment we only deploy the pacman app. A database to store highscores is missing here to keep things simple

## Deploy example
Follow the instructions in the shell script [pacman shell script](./pacman-deploy.sh)

## References
